# The mecor Package
This package for R implements measurement error correction methods for 
measurement error in a continuous covariate or outcome in a linear regression 
with a continuous outcome. 

# Installation
It can be installed via
```r
devtools::install_github("LindaNab/mecor")
```

# Quick demo
```r
library(mecor)
data(icvs)
mecor(Y ~ MeasError(X_star, reference = X) + Z, data = icvs, method = "rc")
```
